This is an implementation of a multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGAII-DMS.
This algorithm is designed for a multiobjective robust MRO model that simultaneously 
optimizes the robust desirabilty functions of the location and dispersion effects of 
multiple responses considering model uncertainty. NSGAII-DMS combines the search mechanisms 
of NSGA-II and DMS. Please refer to the following paper for more details about the model 
and the NSGAII-DMS algorithm:

location effect, dispersion effect, and model uncertainty using hybridization of 
NSGA-II and direct multi-search. Computers & Industrial Engineering, 169, 108247.

The code is developed based on the source code of Yarpiz. The files  'main', 'binTourSel', 
'checkFronts', 'crossover', 'mutation', 'mysort', 'perfectpoint','selecF', 'DMS_process', 
'NonDominatedSortingDMS' , 'genempty' and 'smoothPop' are coded by An-Da Li. 
The file 'NSGAIIDMS' is revised by An-Da Li based on Yarpiz's NSGAII code. Other files 
are coded by Yarpiz.
