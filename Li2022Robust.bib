abstract = {This paper proposes a robust method for multi-response optimization (MRO) considering the location effect, dispersion effect, and model uncertainty simultaneously. We propose a multi-objective optimization model for MRO that simultaneously maximizes the satisfaction degrees of the local and dispersion effects. Specifically, a robust desirability function is used to model the overall satisfaction degree of multiple responses with respect to the two effects. This desirability function evaluates a solutionâ€™s performance considering the confidence intervals predicted by the regression models of location and dispersion effects, and thus, can address the problem of model uncertainty. The proposed multi-objective model yields a set of non-dominated solutions that approximate the Pareto front instead of one single solution, which provides more flexibility for decision makers to select the final best compromise solution based on their preferences. To solve the model, a hybrid multi-objective optimization algorithm called NSGAII-DMS that combines non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) with direct multi-search (DMS) is proposed. NSGAII-DMS uses the search mechanism of NSGA-II during the early evolutionary phase to quickly find a set of non-dominated solutions and then uses the search mechanism of DMS to further tune the found non-dominated solutions. Two test examples have shown that the proposed multi-objective MRO model can produce a set of robust solutions by considering the location effect, dispersion effect, and model uncertainty. Further analyses illustrate that NSGAII-DMS shows significantly better search performance than several well-known multi-objective optimization algorithms, which include NSGA-II, SPEA2, MOEA/D, and DMS.}
