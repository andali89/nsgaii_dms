# nsgaii_dms
This is an implementation of a multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGAII-DMS. This algorithm is designed for a multiobjective robust MRO model that simultaneously 
optimizes the robust desirabilty functions of the location and dispersion effects of multiple responses considering model uncertainty. NSGAII-DMS combines the search mechanisms of NSGA-II and DMS. Please refer to the following paper for more details about the model and the NSGAII-DMS algorithm:
